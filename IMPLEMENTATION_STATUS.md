## 📐 Architecture Decisions

### ULIDs vs UUIDs
- Using ULIDs for all primary keys (sortable, time-based, URL-safe)

### Foreign Keys
- Only on core domain tables (users, programs, sessions)
- Audit/logs/analytics use application-level integrity

### No down() Methods
- Migrations are one-way only (per project guidelines)

### Enums
- PHP 8.1+ enums with helper methods (label(), defaults())

### Units
- Default: kg, km, 0.5 kg rounding, 15 kg barbell
- User-configurable per preferences

### Timezone Handling
- Store UTC in database
- Display in user's local timezone (device-based for PWA)

## 🔗 Key URLs
- Production: `https://tracker.kneebone.com.au`
- Staging: `https://staging.tracker.kneebone.com.au` (Basic Auth: jim/empirefitness)
- Horizon: `/horizon` (production auth gated)
- Filament Admin: `/admin`

## 👥 Default Roles & Permissions
- **Admin**: Full system access, can manage all users, edit global exercises
- **PT**: Can invite members (auto-assigned), manage assigned members, log on behalf, view all member history
- **Member**: Own data only, can create private exercises, can edit assigned programs (with PT notification)
