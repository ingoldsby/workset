### Progression Rules Explained

#### Linear Progression
Add a fixed amount of weight each session or week.

**Example**: Add 2.5kg to squat every week until you reach 150kg.

#### Double Progression
Increase reps within a range, then add weight and drop reps.

**Example**:
- Week 1: 3x8 @ 60kg
- Week 2: 3x10 @ 60kg
- Week 3: 3x8 @ 65kg

#### Wave Periodisation
Vary intensity across weeks in a wave pattern.

**Example**:
- Week 1: Light (70% 1RM)
- Week 2: Medium (80% 1RM)
- Week 3: Heavy (90% 1RM)
- Week 4: Deload (60% 1RM)

#### Percentage-Based Programming
Programme based on percentage of 1RM or training max.

**Example**: Squat 5x5 @ 80% of your 150kg max = 120kg

#### Block Periodisation
Organise training into distinct phases focusing on different adaptations.

**Example**:
- Block 1 (4 weeks): Accumulation (volume focus)
- Block 2 (3 weeks): Intensification (intensity focus)
- Block 3 (2 weeks): Realisation (testing/peaking)
